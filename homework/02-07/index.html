    <p class="p">Here is a small sample of some of the survey data.</p>
    <p class="p">
        The <a href="https://data.somervillema.gov/Happiness/Somerville-Happiness-Survey-Responses/bi8e-5vw8" class="p" style="padding: 0;">Somerville Happiness Survey</a> has been running since 2011, with the most recent data being uploaded in 2019. 
        Every two years, the City of Somerville sends out a questionnaire to a random sample of Somerville residents. 
        The survey asks residents to rate their happiness, well-being, and satisfaction with City services. 
        The current dataset includes <strong>8886</strong> unique responses. Basic questions in the survey include questions such as <strong>“How satisfied are you with your life in general?”</strong> and <strong>“How would you rate the availability of affordable housing?”</strong>
        Additional questions have been added to the questionnaire since its start, with 54 different questions in total being asked over the years. 
        A majority of responses were collected during the inaugural year of the survey, when many of the additional questions such as <strong>“How safe do you feel walking in your neighborhood at night?”</strong> and <strong>“How anxious did you feel yesterday?”</strong> were not yet included. 
        However, even if one were to exclude responses from 2011, there are still 2,719 unique responses left in the dataset.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
        This dataset allows for a rich analysis of how feelings of happiness, anxiety, and satisfaction can differ across different groups, be it gender, race, income, housing status, the languages they speak, or their age. 
        I'm inspired by <a href="https://areyoupressworthy.com/" class="p" style="padding: 0;">this project</a> by Columbia Journalism Review to create an interactive visualization out of the data, where users can input their data to see how they compare to the survey respondents. 
        I think this would be more useful for the broader dataset from 2011 to 2019. 
        After analyzing the data, I anticipate also including an analysis of survey responses from 2013 onward when the questions asked were more comprehensive. 
        I'm particularly interested to see if there are any significant disparities among certain groups of respondents. I imagine this portion combining a scrollytelling feature with an animated, annotated chart.
