                        Somerville, Massachusetts is asking its residents.
                        The city started conducting its bi-annual <a
                            href="https://data.somervillema.gov/Happiness/Somerville-Happiness-Survey-Responses/bi8e-5vw8"
                            target="blank">happiness survey</a> in 2011 to measure the overall happiness and well-being
                        of the city's residents,
                        and to identify factors that contribute to or detract from their happiness. The results are used
                        to inform city planning and policy decisions,
                        with the aim to improve the quality of life for residents, and to make the city a better place
                        to live and work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since its start, the city has collected over 10,000 responses from Somerville residents. Across
                        10 years of data, residents have reported an average
                        happiness rating of 7.5 out of ten. The most recent year of data, 2021, had the lowest average
                        happiness rating yet, but year-to-year differences are marginal.

                        <b>21%</b> of the variance in current happiness is explained by satisfaction with Somerville,
                        according to city analysts. While factors like general life satisfaction explain a greater
                        portion of happiness variance, the city government focuses its efforts on the 21% of variance
                        that policy decisions can affect. The majority of a resident’s satisfaction with Somerville is
                        explained by satisfaction with their specific neighborhood, but survey data has allowed analysts
                        to identify even more detailed determinants of a resident’s happiness rating.

                                question),” said SomerStat Analyst Logan Hughes. “‘Maximum effect’ is measured by
                                multiplying the scale (either 5 or 10 points, depending on the question) by the estimate

                                compare average ratings of factors like general life satisfaction, satisfaction with
                                Somerville, and satisfaction with your neighborhood compared against average ratings of
                                happiness, from 1 to 10. Factors that are positively correlated with happiness will
                                increase as happiness ratings increase.</p>
                            <p>Keep in mind when looking at the data that the "City Services Information," "Social

                                five point scale. In comparison to questions that use a 10 point scale, those lines will
                                look less significant than they actually are. The availability of information about city
                                services, for instance, has the second highest maximum effect score of any of the
                                variables included in SomerStat's analysis. Data depicted here is calculated exclusively from
                                the most recent year of the survey, 2021.
